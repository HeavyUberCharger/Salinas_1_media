My promotional poster is a simple vintage style poster about McDonald's
burgers. It uses bright red and yellow colors to get a vibe of being hungry
and wanting food.The text in the poster says "bigger and less expensive than
ever before." indicationg that the burgers are really bigger and less 
expensive, making it seem like a great deal to get.The illiustration is just a
burger sitting on a couch pose to entise you to get it since it looks very
intriguing.Everything comes together to create a hungry, dream like image 
being a parody of the Maja Desnuda with a modern twist.
