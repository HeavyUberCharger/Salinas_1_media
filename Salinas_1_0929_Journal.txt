How can you loop through all the possible fonts for image magick? [Be specific]

In order to loop through all the possible fonts in image magick you must
follow these steps. First, you will type convert -list font |grep Font|sed -e
"s/.*://g" > fonts.txt in order to get a text file with all of the fonts in 
the machine.next, we will start by making a for loop with the name font in and
pull the text file with $(cat fonts.txt); .Then we will just type do and put
the usual convert code just changing the -font to have "$font" and the name
to have "$font"_ninja.gif; done. that will make many images with each having
