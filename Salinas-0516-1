What challenges are you facing?
Specifically - have you you rendered and submitted anything? Why or why not? 

The challenge I am trying to fix the most is trying to figure out why the 
last snowman cant render in my movie even when hes in editing mode.I did
render and sumitted my project but its still somewhat bad since the snowman
doesnt show and its just 10 seconds of blank.
