What successes have you had in making your images?
So far i had great successs in making my images and making gifs out of them.

How do we use "for" for loops to create images?
we use for loops by adding them in the beginning of our program, then
list all of the colors that we want it to loop through, and incoporate
that loop into our code, mostly by $NAMEOFLOOP

sed is used to replace and edit text. How might we use a text-replacement program to generate more gifs with a for loop?
we can tell it to change certain words of phrases in the passage with the for loop going trough each phrase we added
then making a gif out of it.
