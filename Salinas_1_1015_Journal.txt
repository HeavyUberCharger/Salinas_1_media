How might one use for loops with gradients? 

you would use loops with gradients by applying them in the color parameters.
for example, add 2 for loops in the beginning each having a unique name and
having a list of colors in them. next, where color is needed change it to the
for loop names for both color parameters. finally, make the name of the files
have the color input from the for loops so they are all worded differently and
not overide each other.
