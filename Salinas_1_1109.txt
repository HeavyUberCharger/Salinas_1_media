Do you have plans for another music video?
What are they? What would you do differently? Why? 
 
My plans for another music video  is to take a compilation of the best images
I had made so far and put them with somekind of funk music. What I would 
do differently is to make much better resolution for the images and to make
the transition between them much smoother.
