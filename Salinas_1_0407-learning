First thing I learned in the course of this project is the basics of python.
I have learned the syntax such as the spacing between methods, the way to make
comments, and how to set up loops easily without any hassle.

The second thing I have learned in the course of this project is How to set
up,download, and use libraries inside of the raspberry pi.Many libraries such
as the adafruit libraries to allow me to use the modules, or python libraries
allow me to import things such as opening images or using the webcam in the pi.

The third thing I have learned in the course of this project is how to problem
solve.From getting the camera to wrok to setting up the arduino I was able to
fix some things with the knowlege and help I had from the internet, even though
in the end it never truly helped me.
