This week, I will push to have my basic code for my project done by tuesday.
By thursday, I would like to already be able to display qr codes and make
them be read by my code, but I am still kinda hesitant how long that would
take and dont want to make assumptions until i get into it. hopefully by
friday my prooject will be ready and imported to a PI for final testing
and adding small things.
