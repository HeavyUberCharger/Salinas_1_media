If you were to show your installation piece today - what would you show?
I would show my pi camera module that is hooked up. 

Will you be finished this week? Why or why not?
I am not sure, since I still need to figure out if I am going to get the
qr code scanner working or not

What do you need to accomplish next?
next i will install the qr component and make sure it is operational
