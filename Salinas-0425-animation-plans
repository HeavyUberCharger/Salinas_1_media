It seems that many of you are positively reinforced by animation.
Why? What is it about the animation process that appeals to you?
The reason why the animation process appeals to me is the way we can create
our own enviroment and change anything we want from the animation.

What do you struggle with?
I stuggle trying to find the commands that were needed in order to complete 
the tutorial we did for the snowman.

Would you like to focus the remainder of our time on animation? Why or why not?
Yes I would like to because its fun and easy to understand after you get the
feel of it.
